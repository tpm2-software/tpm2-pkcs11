### 1.4.0 - 2020-08-24
  * Fix superfluous error message when falling back from TPM2\_EncryptDecrypt2 interface.

  * C\_GenerateKeyPair: was not adding PSS signatures as supported by RSA objects, add it.
  * Fix PSS signatures. Non-FIPS mode TPMs produce PSS signatures with a
    max salt len that poses interoperability issues with verifying clients,
    notably TLS in OpenSSL.
  * Fix Java PKCS11 Provider Signature Verification: #401
  * VerifyRecover support, known working with Public Key RSA objects and
    mechanism CKM_RSA_PKCS.
  * db: Modify search and create behavior. See
    [docs/INITIALIZING.md](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-pkcs11/blob/master/docs/INITIALIZING.md)
    for details.
  * Fix printf(3) format specifier errors.
  * ci: increase CI coverage to: Fedora 30, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04.
  * configure: check for Python version >= 3.7 and pass to Automake. No
    need to set PYTHON\_INTERPRETER anymore.
  * Fix segfault/memory corruption bugs in C\_Destroy().
  * Fix segfault when no user pin is provisioned.
  * Support C\_SetAttributeValue.
  * Support for selectable backend using TPM2\_PKCS11\_BACKEND=esysdb being current version.
  * Support for backend fapi that uses the tss2-fapi keystore instead of an sqlite db.
    - This is auto-detected based on tss2-fapi being installed at configure time, and can be controlled
      via --enable/disable-fapi.
  * C\_CreateObject: Support for CKO\_DATA objects only with CKA\_PRIVATE set to CK\_TRUE. Token
    defaults to CK_TRUE.
  * Fix: src/lib/ssl\_util.c:555:54: error: passing argument 3 of ‘EVP\_PKEY\_verify\_recover’ from incompatible pointer type
  * Added tpm2\_ptool link commandlet for linking existing tpm2 objects into a compatible token. For details see
    [this](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-pkcs11/blob/master/docs/INTEROPERABILITY.md) document.

    Supported tpm2 objects are:
      - serialized TPM2B_PUBLIC and TPM2B_PRIVATE data structures, as produced by
      [tpm2_create](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools/blob/master/man/tpm2_create.1.md) -u and -r outputs
      respectively.
      - PEM encoded keys produced by
      [tpm2tss-genkey](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss-engine/blob/master/man/tpm2tss-genkey.1.md)

### 1.2.0 - 2020-03-30
  * Fix PSS signatures. Non-FIPS mode TPMs produce PSS signatures with a

    ESYS\_TR rather than a TPM2\_RH\_.
